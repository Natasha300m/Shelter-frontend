# Hackat0n-2025 Lviv Front-end

[Project URL](https://baratielviv.netlify.app/)

-  This web application is dedicated to supporting lost and abandoned pets by providing them with a second chance at life. Through a user-friendly and compassionate platform, it connects stray or displaced animals with individuals and families who are ready to offer them a safe, loving, and permanent home.

-  Users can take on one of two roles: volunteer or shelter manager. The platform allows posting about pets that need a new owner, a shelter, or a rescue. Additionally, shelters have access to a built-in blog feature, enabling them to share updates, success stories, and useful information with the community.
